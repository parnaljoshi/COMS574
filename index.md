# Warm Up

- \textbf{Newton's First Law of Motion:} Newton's first law states that every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external unbalanced force. \
- \textbf{Einstein's Mass-Energy Equation:} $E = mc^2$ \
- \textbf{Time complexity of Quicksort on average in Big-O notation:} $O(nlogn)$ \

# 

The three types of machine learning are:

- Supervised
- Unsupervised
- Reinforcement

# 

The minimum dimension of the vector is $1*5$ (one row five columns)
