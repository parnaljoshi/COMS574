## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/parnaljoshi/COMS574_HW01/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

# Warm Up

- \textbf{Newton's First Law of Motion:} Newton's first law states that every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external unbalanced force. \
- \textbf{Einstein's Mass-Energy Equation:} $E = mc^2$ \
- \textbf{Time complexity of Quicksort on average in Big-O notation:} $O(nlogn)$ \

# 

The three types of machine learning are:

- Supervised
- Unsupervised
- Reinforcement

# 

The minimum dimension of the vector is $1*5$ (one row five columns)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/parnaljoshi/COMS574_HW01/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
